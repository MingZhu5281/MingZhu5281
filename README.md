## Hello World! 👋

AI/ML has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. From my early days in **Penn State’s RoboX Club** (Computer Vision Department) to researching cutting-edge **AI security techniques**, I’ve always been drawn to the challenge of making machines think, learn, and improve.

From developing secure AI models to optimizing reinforcement learning agents, I specialize in building intelligent systems that are **robust**, **scalable**, and **impactful**. AI isn’t just a career for me—it’s a passion I’ve pursued through **research**, **industry collaboration**, and **real-world problem-solving**.

## 💡 What I Do

I design and implement **AI/ML solutions** with a focus on:

- 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- 🎯 Reinforcement Learning (RL)  
- 🔐 AI Security  
- 👁️ Computer Vision  

**Tech Stack:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, OpenCV, Hugging Face, SQL/NoSQL databases, AWS/GCP
